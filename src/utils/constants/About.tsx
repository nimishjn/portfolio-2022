I am a full stack developer with over one year of experience in **ReactJs**, **NextJs** and **NodeJs**.
I have a passion for building software that is elegant, simple, and functional.
I am not a one-trick programmer. I can build anything from the ground up and have a keen eye for design.
If you have an idea, I have a web solution for you.
I've also had conference papers and book chapters published in IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, and Springer as a **researcher**.
I enjoy music, binge-watching Netflix, and playing basketball.

I am working full-time as a SDE at **[Luganodes](https://luganodes.com/)**. If you have a project that you want to get started, think you need my help with something, or just fancy saying hello, then **[get in touch](#contact)**.
